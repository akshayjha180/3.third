Q-List the components of Hadoop 2.x and explain them in detail.
Sol-
Hadoop 2.x has some common Hadoop API which can easily be integrated with any third party applications to work with Hadoop
It has some new Java APIs and features in HDFS and MapReduce which are known as HDFS2 and MR2 respectively
New architecture has added the architectural features like HDFS High Availability and HDFS Federation
Hadoop 2.x not using Job Tracker and Task Tracker daemons for resource management now on-wards, it is using
YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) for Resource Management
Hadoop 2.x supports two Name Nodes at a time one node is active and another is standby node
Active Name Node handles the client operations in the cluster
StandBy Name Node manages metadata same as Secondary Name Node in Hadoop 1.x
When Active Name Node is down, Standby Name Node takes over and will handle the client operations then after.

# MAP REDUCE(Processing part)
 - Master Daemon - Resource Manager
   High End Machines
   Usually 1 in number
 - Slave Daemon  - Node Manager
   Commodity Machines
   Many in numbers
# HDFS(Storage part)
 - Master Daemon - Namenode
   High End Machines
   Usually 1 in number
 - Slave Daemon  - Datanode
   Commodity Machines
   Many in numbers
